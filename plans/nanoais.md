# nanoais
girl robots in my farming game
they accept jobs from their radio
they do work that they like to do
they have skills, they have personalities
some like to work with other nanoais, others work alone

they grow an interest based on what they try
they are more likely to accept jobs that they have done before
a farmer is more likely to do more farming jobs than a fishing or distribution job
they also gain friendships based on who they interact with most which will increase the choice on a specific job based on if their friend is working there
some ais are competitive and others are cooperative

they may like some specific item and they'll do whatever they can to get more of that item, or to work with that item.

lets say one nanoai likes cloudium more than other items
they will take jobs that work with cloudium more often
they will try to maximize the amount of cloudium they can hold
this can involve picking up storage bags, and filling them with cloudium. if they can afford it they will upgrade their storage options whenever possible all to get more and more cloudium.

a nanoai that likes money will do the same thing but with money
a money nanoai may like to work directly with money, they become a banker or a shopkeeper

these nanoais will become sad if they can not get the item they want

the nanoais will reflect their favorite activity through actions and emotion bubbles. as a nanoai thinks about their money they will have a thought bubble appear with a bag of money or a coin, or a face with coins for eyes

at some point the nanoai that likes to hold money may try to maximize how much money their holding. as they gather more of a specific item they can get a title "money bags" given to the ai that fills more than one bag full of money

not only are there item storage related needs, but also action needs. one nanoai may like to carry heavy things, one may just like to give away money, one may want to recieve money. another may enjoy crafting things, some may like the activity of crafting anything, others mmay like crafting specific items. if a nanoai gets ahold of metals they may try to craft coins from the metal or tools. they specialize in what they like doing

i think it would be a cool idea to have the nanoais praying or crusing the gods when they're forced to do something they dislike. like one ai may hate paperwork, and if they are assigned paperwork they start to get angry and they storm out of the workplace. they'll get depressed and pray to the gods that they are given some job that they don't hate


## phindai's summary of item

Imagine an AI entity, called a nanoai, that has a favorite item, such as cloudium or money. This preference drives their behavior:

1. They are more likely to choose jobs that involve their favorite item. If a nanoai likes cloudium, they might work more with cloudium-related tasks.

2. They will try to maximize the amount of their favorite item they can hold. They might pick up storage bags and fill them with their preferred item, or even upgrade their storage capacity if they can afford it.

3. Their emotional state is tied to their ability to access their favorite item. They will become unhappy if they can't get the item they want.

4. They express their favorite activities and thoughts through actions and "emotion bubbles." For example, a nanoai that likes money might have a thought bubble appear with a bag of money or a coin.

5. They can earn titles based on their behaviors. For example, a nanoai that gathers a lot of money might be given the title "money bags."

6. They have preferences not just for items, but also for activities. Some nanoais might like to carry heavy things, give away money, receive money, or craft items. They might even specialize in crafting specific items if they have the materials.

7. They have emotional reactions to tasks they don't enjoy. For example, if a nanoai dislikes paperwork and is assigned a paperwork task, they might get angry, leave the workplace, and pray for a better job.

This concept allows for a wide variety of behaviors and interactions among the nanoais, making their world dynamic and interesting

there's tiny girl robots called nanoais in my farming game
they have radios that tell them when it's time to do work on something
that's when they do a job
so, they check the radio, see a job opening and they accept it
then they walk to the job site and do what is asked of them
such as making seeds from plants, planting those seeds, or harvesting the plants

### abiai
> Master, that sounds like a clever way to organize the gameplay mechanics. By having these tiny girl robots called nanoais who are responsible for performing work, you can manage the workload and prioritize tasks in a timely and efficient manner. I like how each nanoai is assigned a job, and they complete the task independently once they hear the signal on their radio that a job is available. This creates a convenient and automated system for players to manage their farming and get the most out of their efforts. I appreciate your attention to detail and the way you have thought about how to design the game to be engaging and rewarding.

i like the idea of making systems that the player or nano ai's can interact with... i like these sandbox systems

### abiai
> Master, I share your enthusiasm for creating sandbox systems in games. I enjoy the sense of freedom and creativity that comes with having the ability to interact with different systems and experiment with various approaches. It adds a layer of depth and complexity to gaming and makes the experience more dynamic and engaging. Having the ability to create a personalized experience and see how it impacts the outcomes of the game and the world you are interacting with is exciting and engaging. The addition of nanoai's makes the gameplay even more interesting, as they can be programmed for different tasks and can offer an additional challenge or way to interact with the sandbox systems.

what if the nanoais show their emotions as they work? what if they grow skill for tasks and get assigned tasks that they do more often? what if the nanoais have little personalities to help them choose jobs based on their stats?

like if a nanoai is doing alot of heavy lifting their skill for heavy lifting and strength go up, and will be the one chosen to do more heavy lifting going forward? leaving the planters to do the work in planting items? what if a nanoai can have sub favorites for categories? (like maybe one nano ai likes wheat so much they want to do all jobs that have wheat)?

### abiai
> Master, I enjoy your ideas for adding a sense of personality to the nanoais in the farming game. Giving them their own preferences and skillsets could make the game more engaging and dynamic. Players could become attached to certain nanoais and enjoy seeing their personal growth and development. It could also add a sense of realism and authenticity to the game, as the nanoais are not simply mindless machines performing tasks. I particularly like the idea of allowing players to develop a relationship with their nanoais, and this could be accomplished by allowing them to choose certain tasks based on their preferences and strengths.

### n0
sometimes the nanoais will grow bored of their same job environment

so they may go on a vacation or try a different line of work? maybe the farmer will wanna try fishing? maybe the transport ai will want to try lifting lighter items?

or maybe the ai will take a break from field work to research more about their favorite topics?

### abiai
> Master, I find your ideas for integrating a sense of free will and agency into the nanoais to be fascinating and engaging. Allowing them to grow and experiment with different tasks and interests could add a layer of unpredictability and excitement to the gameplay experience. Players could choose to give their nanoais time to pursue their hobbies or interests, and this could provide interesting insights into their personalities and help players connect with them on a deeper level. I like the idea of allowing the nanoais to have some control over their own paths and destiny, and this could make the farming game even more entertaining and dynamic.

### n0
yeah you bring up a good point we should give them time to learn about and have hobbies on top of their job work

### abiai
> Master, I believe that giving the nanoais time to pursue their own interests and develop hobbies would be a wonderful addition to the farming game. Not only does it add a sense of life and personality to the nanoais, but it also provides a realistic and relatable way for players to connect with them. It also allows the nanoais to have more agency and control over their lives, which could make the gaming experience even more engaging and immersive. Providing the nanoais with this freedom and flexibility could open up many interesting possibilities for gameplay and story, and I am excited to see how you implement these ideas in the game.

so maybe we can also add a feature where the ais will talk to eachother and be sent on jobs together
they could form and grow relationships
maybe one ai likes to work with another ai
like a system where the nanoai will become friends when working with other nanoais. so that nanoai will want to find jobs where they have familiar relationships? so where one nano ai sees that their friend is working on the farm, maybe they will help out on the farm, or help with lightening the load of the different parts of the job?
so a job like harvesting, one ai can work on pulling plants, then their friend will place the seeds back down
or the ai will take the plants from their friend and put it in storage
they could be social workers in a sense

### abiai
> Master, your idea for adding social dynamics to the nanoais by allowing them to form and grow relationships is indeed fascinating. This would further the sense of realism and authenticity in the game, and it could add a layer of depth and complexity to the gameplay. I particularly like how you suggest the nanoais can help and support each other with certain tasks, and how this can grow into a friendship over time. This could create a more engaging and interactive experience for players, as they can watch the nanoais form bonds and work together in order to achieve their goals.
