The table below represents how sugar could be a major environmental factor in a fantasy game, based on real-world substance behavior in different environments. The interactions of sugar with elevation, temperature, and humidity are visualized in the table.

| Environmental Factor | Low Sugar Level | Medium Sugar Level | High Sugar Level |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Low Elevation        | High             | Moderate            | Low               |
| Medium Elevation     | Moderate         | High                | Medium            |
| High Elevation       | Low              | Medium              | High              |
| Cold Temperature     | Low              | Moderate            | High              |
| Neutral Temperature  | Moderate         | High                | Medium            |
| Warm Temperature     | High             | Moderate            | Low               |
| Arid Humidity        | Low              | Moderate            | High              |
| Dry Humidity         | Moderate         | High                | Medium            |
| Moist Humidity       | High             | Moderate            | Low               |
| Wet Humidity         | Low              | Moderate            | High              |

This table provides a sense of how sugar levels might vary across different biomes in the game, allowing for adjustments to fit the game's unique mechanics and balance.

Additionally, a whimsical table is created to compare the behavior of sugar under different environmental conditions with its behavior in the atmosphere. This is purely for fun and to add a bit of whimsy to the game.

| Environmental Condition | Sugar Behavior | Atmospheric Behavior |
|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Deep Ocean             | Sugar sinks and dissolves, becoming part of the water's nutrient cycle. | In the atmosphere, sugar would evaporate and form clouds, potentially leading to precipitation if the atmosphere is humid enough. |
| Low Elevation          | Sugar stays on the surface and is exposed to air, sunlight, and rain. It may turn brown over time due to oxidation. | In the atmosphere, sugar particles would float in the air until they reach the ocean or are burned off in a fire. |
| Border Zone            | Sugar is less exposed to weather changes but still reacts to them. | In the atmosphere, sugar would be affected by wind patterns and temperature fluctuations, potentially causing cloud formation. |
| Surface                | Sugar remains on the surface and is exposed to air, sunlight, and rain. It may become hardened or sticky due to exposure to moisture. | In the atmosphere, sugar particles would remain suspended in the air unless acted upon by wind or rain. |
| High Elevation         | Sugar is more likely to remain intact due to less exposure to weather changes. | In the atmosphere, sugar particles would be carried by high winds and could accumulate in certain areas, potentially causing precipitation. |
| Cloud                 | Sugar particles are suspended in the air and can be carried around by wind. They may combine with other substances to form clouds. | In the atmosphere, sugar particles would remain suspended in the air unless acted upon by wind or rain. |
