# mommyai

when a nanoai picks up another nanoai and both are holding 2 pieces of cloudium 
they can transform into a taller ai called mommyai, 
she is twice the height and can hold twice as much 
(since she keeps the properties of both nanoais)

2 arms + 2 arms = 4 arms (kinda)
the 2nd set of arms are invisible when they're not being used
a mommyai can hold 5 fishing rods
a nanoai can only hold 3 fishing rods
the ais can use as many items as they can physically hold
so mommyai can try to catch 5 fish at the same time, a nanoai can try to catch 3.
there is a loss of total held slots, 
since we use 2 nanoai to make a mommyai (3 slots + 3 slots) 
you may wonder why not 6 slots on mommy ai?

the nanoais use their head as an object holding slot, 
mommyai only has 1 head. so (2 arms + 2 arms + 1 head) = 5

trading between having more slots, or being stronger and faster, and able to reach higher up things... you can fish more efficiently as a mommyai but you can't hold as much stuff
it's trading off the possibility of handing fish to their partner to put in a bin for the ability to fish more effectively... a mommyai can do more things, but the more things comes at the cost of being more dedicated. which is good for tasks, but bad if they gotta also tranport things from place to place.
a nanoai would be very good at transporting items to the mommys who can craft better.

but, there is a requirement to become a mommy. the nanoais have to be lovers
they can split back out of mommyai mode at anytime
the requirement of having cloudium to turn into mommyai is a one time thing. 
think of it like an outfit, 
once you made the mommyai outfit you can just slip back into it whenever you want. 
however, to slip back into mommyai mode after leaving it, 
you need your partner (obviously)
