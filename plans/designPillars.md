## designs
nanoai, farms

### pillars 
1. world is procedural 
(we need a way to get resources for farming, and a place to farm)

2. you can save the world from the bad nanos
   or help the bad nanos take the world over

3. nanos spawn naturally, and you can win them over
become friends with them, ask them for help
assign them to tasks, and they can communicate with each other

4. the world can exist without you. 
the environment may slowly fade into darkness, 
as evil nanos take sugar from the world

5. the world is mainly passive, no weapons.

6. the audience is me


### questions about settings
> is it easy to explain to someone in a way that they grasp the setting in a way that they can imagine it
i do think so.

a player helps bad ais to destroy the world
