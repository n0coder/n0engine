a job is a set of tasks that a nano can do together

a job could be as simple as taking care of crops on a patch of dirt, 

depending on the closeness, a job can be bundled together,
for example: the idea of checking on, seeding, watering, and harvesting crops all together could form a job 
jobs that would not be bundled with it is searching for water, crafting, delivering or protecting the farm

the jobs system is a challenging problem we're gonna solve. 

a job's task has a specific condition which must be met to be taken
for example, we need water to be nearby to queue the watering job
for a collecting water job, we need there to not be too much water in an owned barel and there to be a known source of water 
for finding a water source, we need there to not already be a water source known

this is the general idea, 

we need cotton candy, and a place to craft to craft a cotton candy item
like, making a cotton candy form of lolipop, the nano can make the stick and pop out of cotton candy then stick them together

another job, could be as simple as keeping stalls of cotton candy stocked
