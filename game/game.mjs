//have nano ais appear and run away with the fish
//they give you money if you give them fish
//sometimes evil nanos will try to poison the water
//hire nano ais to defend them
//they will slap the evil ais with their fish
//the evil ais will go away

//if you find sugary fish, you can turn evil ais good

//(the nanoais are your friends and they will have their own lives)
